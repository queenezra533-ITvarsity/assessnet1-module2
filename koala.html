                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
         <p> The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is
             the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of 
             the family Vombatidae.       
        <p>The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, 
            and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-
            shaped 
            nose.</p>
                         
        <p>You will find the koalas at pen E25, right next to the gemsbok.</p>
