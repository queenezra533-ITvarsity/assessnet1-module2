                    <h3>LION</h3>

       <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body,
          short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions 
           have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72
           in). </p>
       <p> Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats,
         but when  persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa
           and North America  </p>    
        <p>  but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western 
         India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have 
          declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of 
        the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
  
                        <p>You will find the lions at pen E26, right next to the koala.</p>
