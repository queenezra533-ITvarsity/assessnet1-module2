                        <p>
                              A single-track mountain bike trail with technical trail features and several black graded options. We guarantee that at the end of the route, it will leave you grinning from ear to ear.

The Monkey trail features technical rock gardens, boardwalks, jumps and drops. The trail finishes with the awesome ‘Lower Cliff’ descent. The start is reached by riding the first half of Follow the Dog Trail.
